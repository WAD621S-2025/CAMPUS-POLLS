# BUZZ-CAMPUS-POLLS-AN-MEMES-G6

# *Introduction & Background* 

The Campus Polls & Memes Platform gives students a lively space to share opinions and humour. Instead 
of conversations staying in small circles, everyone can join in, whether it’s voting on polls or posting memes 
that capture the campus vibe. 
It’s also a place where students feel noticed. If someone talks about a struggle, others can quickly show 
support, which builds positivity and friendships. During campus events, the platform doubles as a real-time 
noticeboard where updates, promotions, and live moments are shared. It’s not just entertainment, it keeps the 
whole campus connected and engaged.

# Problem Statement / Objectives 
# Problem to be solved 
Many campuses do not have a single, easy-to-use platform where students can share their thoughts, 
opinions, and get updates quickly. Traditional noticeboards and group chats are either too formal, messy, or 
not engaging enough. This makes it harder for students to participate, feel part of the community, and have 
their voices heard.

# *General Objective*
To create a web-based platform where students can take part in polls, share memes, and interact in real time, 
helping them connect, express themselves, and engage with campus life. 
# Specific Objectives (SMART) 
1. Polls: Make an easy-to-use interface for creating and voting in polls, ensuring at least 80% of users 
can use it without help within the first month. 
2. Memes: Allow students to upload and view memes about campus life, aiming for at least 50 uploads 
in the first two months. 
3. Live Feed: Set up a real-time feed for updates, challenges, and event news, ensuring posts appear 
instantly and 90% of users can see them without delay. 
4. Feedback: Enable students to comment or react to posts quickly, targeting at least 70% of posts 
receiving responses within 24 hours. 
5. Event Promotion: Share campus events on a live, interactive board, promoting at least 5 events each 
month. 
6. Participation: Encourage active use of the platform, aiming for at least 60% of students to log in 
and interact at least once per week to build a stronger campus community.

# Technologies to be Used: 
• Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the website design and interactivity.

• Database: MySQL to store user data, posts, polls, and events. 

• Frameworks/Libraries: Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for styling; optional JS libraries for dynamic 
content.

This platform will serve as a central place for students to share, connect, and stay updated in a fun 
and interactive way.
